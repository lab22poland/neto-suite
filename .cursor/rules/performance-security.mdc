# Performance & Security Guidelines

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize network operations for mobile battery usage
- Use async/await for network requests
- Implement proper error handling for network failures
- Consider offline functionality where applicable

## Security Guidelines
- Use App Sandbox on macOS (already configured)
- Implement secure network communication (TLS/SSL)
- Follow iOS security best practices for network tools
- Protect sensitive network credentials and configurations

## Network Operations
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use proper timeout values for network requests
- Handle network reachability changes gracefully
- Cache network responses when appropriate

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure storage mechanisms (Keychain, etc.)
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Follow platform-specific security guidelines

## Performance Monitoring
- Monitor memory usage and avoid leaks
- Profile network operations for optimization
- Implement proper lifecycle management for network connections
- Use instruments for performance analysis
