# Deployment & CI/CD Guidelines

## App Store Distribution
- Support for iOS App Store and Mac App Store distribution
- Test builds on both iOS simulators and macOS before release
- Maintain version parity across all supported platforms

## Build Configuration
- Use Xcode 16.4+ for all builds
- Maintain consistent build settings across platforms
- Ensure proper code signing configuration

## Testing Requirements
- All tests must pass on target platforms before deployment
- Run tests on:
  - macOS (running version)
  - iPhone 16 simulator
  - iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) simulator

## Version Management
- Coordinate version releases across all submodules
- Update version numbers consistently
- Tag releases in all relevant repositories

## Platform-Specific Considerations
- iOS/iPadOS: Follow App Store Review Guidelines
- macOS: Ensure proper notarization and code signing
- Test on minimum supported OS versions before release

## Release Workflow
1. Test all components independently
2. Update submodule references in main repository
3. Create coordinated release tags
4. Submit to respective app stores
5. Monitor deployment success
