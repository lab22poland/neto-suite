# NETo Testing Guidelines

## Testing Framework
- Use **XCTest** framework for all testing
- Write unit tests for all network utility functions
- Include UI tests for critical user workflows

## Test Coverage
- Test on both iOS simulator and macOS for multiplatform compatibility
- Ensure all network utility functions have corresponding unit tests
- Cover edge cases and error scenarios

## Default Test Execution
Run all tests on the following platforms unless explicitly stated otherwise:
- **macOS**: Running macOS version
- **iOS**: iPhone 16 simulator
- **iPadOS**: iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) simulator

## Test Organization
- Group tests by functionality
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Performance Testing
- Include performance tests for network operations
- Test battery usage optimization scenarios
- Validate offline functionality where applicable
